## Angus Pettifer

I’m a maths graduate who has leapt out of a (reasonably) successful career in banking to explore the greener grass to the east of the city. I’m currently learning to learn to code at Makers Academy and am thoroughly looking forward to being a fully-fledged software developer.

For the past 6.5 years I have been working at Merrill Lynch in the centre of a loud, fast-paced trading floor; buying and selling government debt and interest rate derivatives. However, a quest for problem solving and project driven work as well as a more flexible work-life led me to up sticks.

## Skills

#### Skill 1

To work out of my comfort zone

“You have a unique confidence to try something that you have little to no expertise in” a good friend told me when I was considering the career shift to coding. I was flattered by the compliment but save for the use of the word unique, I think it is fairly accurate. If anyone asks for a volunteer I’m always the first to put my hand up. I feel that one learns much quicker when you have to, so I like to jump in with two feet.


#### Skill 2

Why?

I mentioned my objection to the word unique in skill[0]. This brings me to my second trait, always asking why? I have a desire for accuracy that borders on being pedantic. As an example, in my most recent role I challenged senior management in the way that we processed government debt auctions as I felt that our existing practice was not compliant. I then created and implemented the new process. This was off my own back and not part of my day-to-day job but something that made the business stronger and less likely to be fined by regulators for improper practice (we had been fined over $50bn since 2008).

Communication
The trading floor was fast-paced and aggressive. As a sales-person I was the client’s interface to their transaction with us. As the market moves on a second by second basis, huge fluctuations occur in valuations of products we trade – including in the middle of a trade. This meant clear, concise, quick and accurate communication was imperative, a lack of clarity could be very expensive for both the client and the firm. I believe that this will translate well into software development where communication with project managers, users, UX designers etc is so important.

## Experience

**Bank of America Merrill Lynch** (Jul 11 – Feb 18)

My last year focused mainly on the project management of various electronic trading systems as a regulatory requirement – MiFID II. I was responsible for implementing a procedure that totally revamped the way that we traded billions of dollars of government debt and interest rate derivatives on a daily basis. I worked with legal, compliance, audit and advised several teams of developers on their respective projects.

Prior to that my role included trade execution (a high pressure role), relationship management, data analysis and investment advice.
