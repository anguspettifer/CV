## Angus Pettifer

I am a maths graduate who has leapt out of a (reasonably) successful career in banking to explore the greener grass to the east of the city. I chose software because I love problem solving and want to create tangible solutions. I have just graduated from [Makers](https://makers.tech/) where I was learning to learn to code and am excited about what I am going to make today.

Want to know more about how I think? [Here](https://blog.makersacademy.com/painting-your-face-green-and-making-a-ship-out-of-glass-a-balancing-act-9fc2f9fc1f46) is my blog.

## Skills

To work out of my comfort zone

“You have a unique confidence to try something that you have little to no expertise in” a good friend told me when I was considering the career shift to coding. I was flattered by the compliment but, save for the use of the word unique, I think it is fairly accurate. Dyslexia made the early part of my education a slow and frustrating process. Over the years I came to realise that working harder than peers in order to achieve the same result was not sufficient, I had to adapt. I taught myself to be organised and break down problems which allowed me to take on seemingly daunting tasks. I think it was this experience that lead me to love new challenges. I have a yearning for learning.


Asking why

I am willing to challenge the status quo if I believe that there is a better alternative. As an example, in my most recent role I challenged senior management in the way that we processed government debt auctions as I felt that our existing practice could be more compliant. Following a meeting with management, I set about creating and implementing a new process. This was off my own back and not part of my day-to-day job but something that made the business stronger and less likely to be fined by regulators for improper practice (we had been fined over $50bn since 2008).


Communication

Working on a trading floor, clear, quick and accurate communication was imperative; a lack of clarity could be very expensive for both the client and the firm. I believe that this will translate well into software development where communication with project managers, the business, UX designers etc is so important. From my team projects at makers I have learnt that speaking up early about an issue can reduce pain down the line.

## Experience

**Bank of America Merrill Lynch** (Jul 11 – Feb 18)  
*Vice President - Rates Sales*

My last year focused mainly on the project management of various electronic trading systems as a regulatory requirement – MiFID II. I was responsible for implementing a procedure that totally revamped the way that we traded billions of dollars of government debt and interest rate derivatives on a daily basis. I worked with legal, compliance, audit and advised several teams of developers on their respective projects.

Prior to that my role included data analysis, investment advice and relationship management.

## Hobbies

- Never happier than with a delicious cup of coffee and a copy of the economist or prospect magazine
- Kitesurfing and Sailing (Dinghy instructor and day skipper) – addicted to wind forecast and pressure charts
- Rugby – avid supporter, lack the physique to play
- Dancing – mainly bathroom and kitchen, but also to the occasional busker
- I also enjoy tennis, golf, skiing, triathlon and any other sport that will justify drinking in the sun
