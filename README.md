## Angus Pettifer

I am a maths graduate who has leapt out of a (reasonably) successful career in banking to explore the greener grass to the east of the city. I chose software because I love problem solving and wanted to shift into a more creative realm. I am currently learning to learn to code at Makers (INSERT LINK TO MAKERS WEBSITE) and am excited about what I am going to build today.

Want to know more about how I think? [This](https://blog.makersacademy.com/painting-your-face-green-and-making-a-ship-out-of-glass-a-balancing-act-9fc2f9fc1f46) is my blog.

## Code


Code ethos:

Makers teaches us that code should be test driven. We start TDD on the first day and it is the cornerstone throughout the course. Daily pair programming, whilst continually changing pairs quickly enforces the need to have readable code. We also are encouraged to keep our code DRY and to follow the SOLID principles in OO development.

In my former job, just before I left there was a far-reaching expansion of existing technologies for regulatory requirements. It is now clear to me that this codebase had not been test driven. New errors popped up after every release which was very costly for the business.

I am a convert to the practice that Makers preach.

We had a stand up each morning and would take turns in running each of these ceremonies. We maintained a trello board for workflow.

## Skills

#### Skill 1

To work out of my comfort zone

“You have a unique confidence to try something that you have little to no expertise in” a good friend told me when I was considering the career shift to coding. I was flattered by the compliment but save for the use of the word unique, I think it is fairly accurate. If anyone asks for a volunteer I am usually the first to put my hand up. I feel that you learns much quicker when you have to, so I like to jump in with two feet.


#### Skill 2

Asking why

I am willing to challenge the status quo if I believe that there is a better alternative. As an example, in my most recent role I challenged senior management in the way that we processed government debt auctions as I felt that our existing practice could be more compliant. Following a meeting with management, I set about creating and implementing a new process. This was off my own back and not part of my day-to-day job but something that made the business stronger and less likely to be fined by regulators for improper practice (we had been fined over $50bn since 2008).

#### Skill 3

Communication

Working on a trading floor, clear, quick and accurate communication was imperative; a lack of clarity could be very expensive for both the client and the firm. I believe that this will translate well into software development where communication with project managers, the business, UX designers etc is so important. From my team projects at makers I have learnt that speaking up early about an issue can reduce pain down the line.
